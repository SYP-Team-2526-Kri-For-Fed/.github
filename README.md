# Project Assignment

## Project Name - BoardVerse

## Background

We’ve been frustrated by how hard it is to get everyone together in one place for a board game night. That’s why we want to create a board game platform. Unlike most existing sites that only offer a single game (like chess or checkers), ours will bring multiple games together in one place, so players don’t need to keep switching between different websites. Another common problem with online board game platforms is that playing against strangers often feels isolating. To fix this, we’ll add built-in chat features, making it easier to connect and interact with fellow players.

## Project Goals

1. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

   * Chess and Battleship with real-time multiplayer
   * Simple game lobby
   * Basic in-game chat

2. **Expansion**

   * Add more games (e.g., Checkers, Connect Four)
   * Group creation and invitations
   * Chat improvements (emojis, gif)
   * AI opponents for solo play (optional)

3. **Community Features**

   * User accounts and profiles
   * Leaderboards and achievements
   * Club/group management and history

## Project Content

* Technical implementation: Development of the platform (frontend, backend, database).
* Game mechanics: Implementation of core games and game logic.
* Multiplayer functionality: Setup of matchmaking, lobby, and real-time communication.
* Communication: Integrated chat with basic functions (later expanded).
* User management: Registration, login, profiles.
* Testing & QA: Ensuring stability and user-friendliness.
* Deployment: Setup of the platform in a production environment.

## Critical Success Factors

* User-friendliness: Easy to use and quick onboarding options.
* Stability & performance: Low latency for real-time multiplayer.
* Game selection: At least 2 functioning games in the MVP.
* Community interaction: Acceptance of chat functions and profile features.
* Time and budget compliance: Adherence to project deadlines and resource requirements.
